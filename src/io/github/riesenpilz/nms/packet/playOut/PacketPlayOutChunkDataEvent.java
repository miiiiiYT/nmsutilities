/**
 * https://wiki.vg/Protocol#Chunk_Data
 * <p>
 * The server only sends skylight information for chunk pillars in the
 * Overworld, it's up to the client to know in which dimension the player is
 * currently located. You can also infer this information from the primary
 * bitmask and the amount of uncompressed bytes sent. This packet also sends all
 * block entities in the chunk (though sending them is not required; it is still
 * legal to send them with Update Block Entity later).
 * <p>
 * Note that the Notchian client requires an Update View Position packet when it
 * crosses a chunk border, otherwise it'll only display render distance + 2
 * chunks around the chunk it spawned in.
 * <p>
 * The compacted array format has been adjusted so that individual entries no
 * longer span across multiple longs, affecting the main data array and
 * heightmaps.
 * <p>
 * Packet ID: 0x22<br>
 * State: Play<br>
 * Bound To: Client
